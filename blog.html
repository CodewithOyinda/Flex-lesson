            <p>Just as we all know, it is through career planning that a person evaluates abilities, interests, considers alternative career opportunities and plans practical developmental activities. As a graduate of Food Science and Technology, work experience is highly valued by employers. The main employers of food science graduates are food manufacturers, producers, processors and retailers. Based on my level of experience so far from my IT in my 4th year in the University and my NYSC, i realised that i do not have enough practical experience to earn me the best job in my field.</p><br>
            <p>Six months into my service, i kept making my research, although i had a business (Makeup Artistry) that kept me all through the self discovery process which i'm still very much into. On a faithful day, i had a discussion with my friend Marvelous Oyediji who is a web developer. She told me about her plans of starting up her Tech School and she asked if i was willing to pertake in the training. At first i was reluctant based on what i've heard people say about Tech and also my experience in my second year in school offering computer Programming (C++) which was all theoritical and difficult to understand. After the whole conversation, i thought deeply and a scripture crossed my mind, "I can do all things Through Christ Who Strengthens Me"-Philipians 4:13. However, this became my watchward. </p><br>
           <p>I finally informed my elder brother who is always willing to support my career. He encouraged me and got me a system to make learning easier. During my course of training (which is currently ongoing), i learnt how to build web pages with HTML and CSS and my curiosity and love for technology never stops. I've had to also seek mentorship from Stephen Kalson a senior Frontend Developer who got introduced to me through a friend.</p><br>
           <p>So far, i have learnt some valuable lessons that has not only helped me become a better web developer but also kept me interested in this industry and put me on a career path i never expected years ago. Thank you and cheers to many more success stories to come!</p>
